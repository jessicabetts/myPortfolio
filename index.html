    <p>Welcome to my site. I'm so glad you've found it. Here, you will find several interesting things including a guide to my extensive writing, some links to show you other websites I've developed and projects I'm working on, and even some fun facts about me. </p>
    <p>Perhaps you can tell by the way my name is all over this site, but I feel I must mention that I made it myself, by hand. Well, by hands on the keyboard, typing document after document to get this site just how I like it. That being said, if you find any problems with this site please shoot me an email.</p>
    <p>Speaking of emails, I'll be sending one around to keep everyone up-to-date on the status of my writing, my job, my favorite recipies, and so forth. If you are interested, and if you are that probably means you're my mom because who else would care that much about my ramblings? But if you are, you can submit your email to my list. Put in your email and push that button over there. ----> </p>
